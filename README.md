# natural-language

natural-language commands to operate an intent based network


## Business/Technical Challenge

Operate and troubleshooting a network is not an easy task and usually is a time demanding task – impacting directly the Business representing a high OPEX. 

## Proposed Solution


Taking advantage of the Natural Language technology, we will demonstrate how to do some key tasks using Google Home as a “Next Generation NOC”. 
Instead commands, the operator will ask to Google Home:
“What’s happening with the user “HugoM” in my network? Please print the result in my Webex team room..”
Look’s simple and the good news is, it is really simple! Let’s make this happen!
